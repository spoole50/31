## Game Rules

**Objective:** Get the highest total value of cards in the same suit. A score of 31 is an instant win.

**Card values:**
- Ace — 11 points
- King, Queen, Jack — 10 points each
- Number cards — face value (2–10)

**Special cases:**
- Three Aces = 31 (instant win for holder — everyone else loses a life)
- Getting 31 = instant win for the round

**Gameplay:**
1. Each player is dealt 3 cards and receives 3 lives
2. On your turn: draw from the deck or discard pile, then discard one card
3. **Knock** to trigger the final round — all other players get one last turn
4. The player with the lowest hand score loses a life
5. Ties for lowest both lose a life
6. Last player with lives remaining wins

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
source ../.venv/bin/activate      # or: python -m venv ../.venv && source ../.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install                        # first time only
npm run dev                        # starts on http://localhost:3000
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/socket.io` to `http://localhost:8000` automatically.

### Stop servers

```bash
# Frontend — Ctrl+C in that terminal

# Backend — Ctrl+C, or kill by port:
lsof -ti :8000 | xargs kill
```

### Health check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
# {"status":"healthy","version":"2.0.0","games":0,"tables":0,"connected_players":0,"redis":false}
```
